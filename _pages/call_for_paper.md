## Submission Guidelines
**Paper formatting:** Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and tables, in the ICCV 2025 style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Please download the [ICCV 2025 Author Kit](https://media.eventhosts.cc/Conferences/ICCV2025/ICCV2025-Author-Kit-Feb.zip) for detailed formatting instructions.

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission and review process:** Review process is double-blind. We will be using OpenReview to manage submissions. Similar to the review process for [ICCV 2025 conference](http://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025), submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee. The reviews and author responses will never be made public, and we will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. 

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. By submitting a paper to this workshop, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the OpenReview system to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers.

OpenReview author instructions can be found [here](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/CompleteYourORProfile).
